Scripts

chameleon
---------
A background changer

	$ chameleon --help
	Usage: chameleon [options] <target>
	Options:
		-m|--bg-manager      # Specify a bg manager to use. The default is feh.
		-M|--bg-mode         # Specify the bg mode.
		-C|--color           # Specify a color for the background.
		                       If used without a target image, fills the background with the color.
		                       Needs imagemagick for that though.

miner
-----
Miner is a simple tool to merge (patch) zip archives.

	$ miner
	Usage: miner <zip0> <zip1>

ixio
----
A client for ix.io. I didn't like the official one.  
Depends on curl.

	$ cmd | ixio
	or
	$ ixio < file

	$ ixio -h
	Usage: ixio [flags] < <file>
	Flags:
		-h|--help            Show this message
		-d|--delete <id>     Delete an id
		-p|--put <id>        Overwrite an id
		-l|--limit <num>     Number of times the paste can be read before it's deleted.
		-u|--user            Username for autherntication. Turns on authentication.
		-n|--auth-toggle     Toggle authentication. Turns authentication on or off (even if a username is supplied) depending
		                       on the default set in the config file (if any). Without one, the default is on.

sprunge
-------
A script for sprunge, because I'm weird and hate aliases.  
Depends on curl.

	$ cmd | sprunge
	or
	$ sprunge < file

imgur
-----
imgur is a relatively simple imgur client. It does not support authorization.

	Usage: imgur [flags] [path]
	Flags:
		-h    Show this message.
		-s    Make a screenshot and upload that. If a path is specified, the screenshot is saved there.
		      If the path is a dir, the screenshot will be saved under that directory with a random name.
		      You can override the default tmp dir (/tmp) in the config file with `tmp_dir=<path>`
		-F    Make a fullscreen screenshot instead of asking you to select a window or an area. Implies -s.
		-R    Remove the file after uploading.
		-c    Source an alternative config file.
	
	Using several keys in a row (like -sFR) is not supported.
	There is no support for putting the image URL into the X clipboard. That's stupid. Just do `imgur | xclip`.
	You can set some stuff in a config file. Look in the argument handling part of the script for details.
	The default path is $HOME/.config/imgur.rc.sh

i3lock-extra
------------
An i3-lock wrapper for doing fancy shit.

	Usage: i3lock-extra <-m mode> [args]
	Flags:
		--mode|-m <mode>    # Lock mode.
		--tmpdir|-d <path>  # Directory to store temporary files in. This should not be accessible by other users!
		--pixelize-scape|-p # For the pixelize mode only. Sets the number by which the image is resized down and
		                      back up to achieve the pixelize effect. For example, 4 means that it will be resized
		                      to 1/4 of the original and blown back up.
	Modes:
		rnd <dir>           # Use a random image from a dir.
		blur [img]          # Take a screenshot, blur it out. If provided, add an image on top.
		pixelize [img]      # Same as the above, but pixelize the image instead.
		img <img>           # Use the provided image.

lockd

	Usage: lockd [-r <rundir>] [-p <poll_rate>] <command>

secret
------
Very basic password manager. Uses GPG.

	g|get <tag>       # Get a password into your clipboard.

	c|clear           # Clear the terminal.
